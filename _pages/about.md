Didier Ishimwe is a Computer Science PhD candidate at George Mason University, where he is a member of the [ROARS](https://roars.dev) lab under the advisement of Dr. Thanhvu Nguyen. His research sits at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning, focusing on the development of rigorous verification techniques, including neural network verification, automated performance analysis, and the application of Generative LLMs to enhance software analysis workflows.

In addition to his doctoral research, Didier is a Machine Learning Engineer at Experian, where he develops internal LLM-based tools for the Experian AI Assistant. He holds a Master of Science in Computer Science from [University of Nebraska](https://computing.unl.edu/) and a Bachelor of Arts from [William Penn University](https://www.wmpenn.edu/). His work aims to bridge the gap between formal software analysis and the evolving capabilities of modern AI systems.
