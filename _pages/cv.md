Education
======
* **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 2026
* **M.S. in Computer Science**, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, 2021
* **B.A. in Computer Science**, William Penn University, Oskaloosa, IA, 2018

Work Experience
======

### Industry
**Experian: Machine Learning Engineer**
* Developing internal LLM-based tools designed to support the Experian AI Assistant.

### Research
**George Mason University: Research Assistant (2022 – Present)**
* *Input Generation*: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate pathological inputs for performance testing and debugging to help developers identify worst-case execution scenarios.
* *Complexity Analysis*: Designed and implemented an algorithm to analyze worst-case running time complexity of recursive programs to help developers evaluate performance bottlenecks regardless of programming language.

**University of Nebraska Lincoln: Research Assistant (2018 – 2021)**
* *Verification*: Developing developer tools to efficiently prove numerical assertions and resource bounds often found in safety-critical systems.
* *Predictive Failure Avoidance*: Developed an algorithm to abstract inputs leading to program failures (e.g., assertion violations) and automatically repair them to ensure successful program execution.
* *Dynamic Invariant Generation*: Produced non-trivial numerical invariants from execution traces useful for verifying the absence of errors in safety-critical systems.

**Purdue University: Research Assistant (Summer 2017)**
* *NanoCluster Evolution Prediction*: Built a simulation tool to visualize and predict the size evolution of irradiation-induced nanoclusters in iron-based materials.

### Teaching
**George Mason University: Adjunct Professor**
*Courses*: Formal Methods & Models
*Responsibilities include:*
  * Designed and developed course content to align with university learning objectives.
  * Create quizzes, assignments and exams tailored to reinforce key learning goals.
  * Delivered weekly lectures and held office hours for students support and engagement.
  * Managed a team of teaching assistants responsible for tutoring and grading.
  * Conducted individual student meetings to discuss academic progress and strategies for success.
