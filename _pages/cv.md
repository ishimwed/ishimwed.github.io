Education
======
* B.A. in Applied Computer Science & Applied Math, William Penn University, 2018
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2021
* Ph.D in Computer Science, George Mason University, 2023 (expected)

Work Experience
======
### George Mason University: Research Assistant
  * *Automated Resource Analysis*: Designed and implemented algorithms for user-defined resource analysis (ex: number of API hits in a program).
  * *Performance Testing*: Working performance testing by using reinforcement learning and Large Language Models to generate pathological inputs for developers to debug worst-case execution of programs

### University of Nebraska Lincoln: Research Assistant
  * *Automated Complexity Analysis*: Designed and implemented an algorithm to analyze worst-case running time complexity of recursive programs. This algorithm can be used for profiling systems
  * *Predictive Failure Avoidance*: Abstracting inputs that leads to program failures (ex: assertion violations) and automatically repairing those inputs so that the program runs successfully with acceptable output
  * *Dynamic Invariant Generation*: Compute non-trivial numerical invariants from execution traces. Invariants are useful to verify the absence of errors in safety critical systems

### University of Nebraska Lincoln: Teaching Assistant
  * Compiler Construction
  * Software Testing & Verification
  * Intro to Computer Science

### Purdue University: Research Assistant
  * *NanoCluster Evolution Prediction*: Built a simulation tool to predict size evolution of solute nanoclusters in metallic alloys under irradiation
