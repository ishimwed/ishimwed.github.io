This is an extended abstract for FSE 23 Student Research Competition. Thisabstract summarizes my research in automated complexity analysis using dynamically inferred recurrence relations with a focus on annihilator method for solving these recurrences. The use of annihilator method allows learning correct bounds for popular classical recursive programs (e.g. ùëÇ (n^2)
for quicksort), achieving more precise bounds for exponential programs than previously reported (e.g. ùëÇ ( ( 1+ \sqrt{5} )^n ) for fibonacci), and capturing a wide range of bounds including non-linear polynomial and non-polynomial, logarithmic, and exponential relations.
